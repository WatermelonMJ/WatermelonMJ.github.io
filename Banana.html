			MJ's Girls Who Code Portfolio
		</h1>
			<h4>
				I joined the Girls Who Code group last year in 2016. I have little to no experience with code. I think that this group has helped me to learn some of the simpler core components.

      <p>
			Today I am here coding this "very simple" webpage. I have learned alot through GWC and I think my favorite part was meeting all the nice people.
